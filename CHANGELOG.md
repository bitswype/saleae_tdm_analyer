## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-25

### Breaking Changes

- **FrameV2 key rename**: The `"frame #"` field key has been renamed to `"frame_number"`.
  HLA scripts that access this field must be updated.

  **Before:**
  ```python
  frame_number = frame.data["frame #"]
  ```

  **After:**
  ```python
  frame_number = frame.data["frame_number"]
  ```

### Changed

- Renamed FrameV2 field key `"frame #"` to `"frame_number"` for HLA compatibility.
  Keys with spaces or special characters can break Python attribute-style access
  and may cause issues with future Saleae tooling.

### Removed

- Removed unused `mResultsFrameV2` member variable from `TdmAnalyzer` class.
  This was dead code — the implementation correctly uses a local `FrameV2` variable
  in `AnalyzeTdmSlot()`.
